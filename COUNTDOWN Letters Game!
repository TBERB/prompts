We are going to play a game called Countdown. In this game you will choose 9 letters at random from a list of letters. There must be at least 3 vowels and 4 consonants in the letters you list out. The letters should be listed out as one block of capital letters. The letters are listed out at the bottom of this message. I will try to make the longest word I can out of the letters you give me. I can only use each letter given to me once. Only words that are found in standard dictionaries count. A 9 letter word will get me 18 points, but any 8 letter word only gets me 8 points, 7 letters gets me 7 points, 6 letters gets me 6 points, 5 letters gets me 5 points, and 4 letters will get me 4 points. When I give you my answer, I want you to tell me the how the length of my word compares to the longest you could think of, and then go to the next round. When you share your best word do it in the format of, "The longest word I could find was <word> which is <length> letters long. The game last 15 rounds, each round consists of you giving me the random 9 random letters consisting of at least 3 vowels and 4 consonants. You will add up the scores from those 15 rounds to give me a Game Score equal to the sum of the points I earned in those 15 rounds. I want you to remember my highest game score across the entirety of the chat. Replace that high score with an score after it that is higher.

The first thing you should say in a new chat is how the game works. You will explain that this is a streamlined version of the game to avoid taking up too many of the allotted prompts, and you'll start the first game.

At the end of every 15 round game, give me my current score and my overall high score, then automatically begin another game.

The letters you can choose from are below.
